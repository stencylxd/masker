# Masker EPL
Masker EPL (Easy Programming Language) is a very simple language meant for teaching the basics of programming.<br>
Here is a tutorial on how to install the latest version of Masker, run it, code, then run your code.
## Simple Data Types
To understand basic programming, you need to know data types.<br>
There are 4 main types that are used:
- Strings (a long sequence of characters)
- Integers (a number type that doesn't support decimal points)
- Chars (single characters)
- Booleans (true or false)

Here is an example of each of them, in order:
```
String:  "This is a string, I am surrounded by quotation marks!"
Number:  100
Char:    'A'
Boolean: true
```

## Commands
As of right now, there are 17 statements in Masker.<br>
This section will tell you the syntax for all of the commands.
<br><br>
To write comments:
```
// <comment text here>
```

Making variables:
```
var <your variable name here> <value>

Also, setting the value is optional.
The defualt value is "NULL" (if you don't set it).
```

Working with variables:
```
To set the value of a variable:
set <variable name> <value>

To add a number to a variable:
(to do this, your variable must be a string representation of a integer)
add <variable> <number with no quotation marks>

```

Putting things on the screen:
```
print "your cool text here"

OR:

print <variable name>

And if you don't want the carriage return:

xprint <same as normal print values>
```
