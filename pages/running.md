# Running Code

This page will teach you how to run code.<br>
Just open a terminal and run masker like this:
```
Linux / OSX: 
./masker <file name>

Windows:
./masker.exe <file name>
```

Code is compiled by first scanning for all CP statements.<br>
Then it runs the code line by line, ignoring CP statements.<br><br>
If there are errors in your code, it will tell you with something like this:
```
ERROR: <reason for error here> (Line Number: <line number here>)
```

Sometimes it will give you a value to help even more.<br><br>
